# Flask Experiment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ethanphunter/FlaskExperiment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ethanphunter/FlaskExperiment)

I originally wrote this app as practice to make myself more familiar with Flask, Heroku, and to touch up on my python skills. It has now become a turn based game system that you can play chess on. (And hopefully someday other games as well) If you have any questions feel free to make an issue or contact me!

#### Dependancies
The following dependancies are a few of the ones I use in this project, you can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` after starting your virtual environment.
  - virtualenv `pip install virtualenv`
  - Flask `pip install flask`
  - requests[security] `pip install requests[security]`
  - gunicorn `pip install gunicorn`
  - passlib `pip install passlib`
  - psycopg2 `pip install psycopg2`
  - Heroku, go to the heroku website to download the tool belt.
