## Flask Example

I wrote this app as practice to make myself more familiar with Flask, Heroku, and to touch up on my rusty python skills.

#### Dependancies
I used the following dependancies in this project:
  - virtualenv `pip install virtualenv`
  - Flask `pip install flask`
  - requests[security] `pip install requests[security]`
  - gunicorn `pip install gunicorn`
  - Heroku, go to the heroku website to download the tool belt.
